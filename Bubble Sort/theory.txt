Bubble Sort Algorithm: 
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high. After each round/loop the largest element is moved to the end of the array.
Time Complexity: O(N^2)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(N2). The worst case occurs when an array is reverse sorted.
Best Case Time Complexity: O(N). The best case occurs when an array is already sorted.
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Bubble sort is stable
