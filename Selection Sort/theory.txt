Selection Sort Algorithm: 
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a single array.

Time Complexity: The time complexity of Selection Sort is O(N^2)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
